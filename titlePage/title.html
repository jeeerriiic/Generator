                <h2>Created by Jeric Miranda</h2>
                <p><span>Generator</span> is a personal project that  I created to better my understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also created this project for simplicity in design and creativity, instead of spending too much time on certain different aspects of my life. I use this generator to keep things simple and work with whatever the generator has chosen for me. By using the randomly generated outcomes it helps me get more work done or start work sooner rather than thinking of what I am going to do. Not to mention it also helps me build adaptive skills and critical thinking skills when working on creative designs.</p>

                <h3>Color Generator</h3>
                <p>I use the <span>Color Generator</span> whenever I have a problem of taking too much time on what color I want to use whether or not it is for projects I am working on or choosing a color in a video game I am playing.</p>
    
                <h3>Number Generator</h3>
                <p>I use the <span>Number Generator</span> whenever I have multiple options such as what food to eat or where to eat, what kind of character to play in a video game or skills to use, what kind of activity to do at that moment, etc.</p>
    
                <h3>Username Generator</h3>
                <p>I use the <span>Username Generator</span> when I am coming up with a name for the created character I made in a video game.</p>
